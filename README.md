<h2>Backups</h2>

Boiron CA Website really put up a fight for backups, I eventually had to utilize the Updraft Plus plugin to get a backup. TheDuplicator plugin did not function and was giving 500 errors. You can find the Updraft Plus plugin on dropbox here --> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/home/Matt's%20Website%20Backups%20Duplicator/CANADA%20MAIN%20-%20UPDRAFT%20PLUS">Click me to head to the backup</a>

Also you can find the Snapshot here --> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/home/Matt's%20Website%20Backups%20Duplicator/CANADA%20MAIN%20-%20UPDRAFT%20PLUS/CANADA%20SNAPSHOT%20WPMU">Click me for Snapshot</a>

<h2>Changing the three main divs focused on BMF, Coupons, and Shop</h2>
